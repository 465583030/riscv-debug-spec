        There are separate \Fhaltreq and \Fresumereq bits so a debugger can
        write \Rdmcontrol without affecting the current state, without knowing

        Writes to this register cause the corresponding abstract command to be

        Writing while an abstract command is executing causes \Fcmderr to be set.

        If \Fcmderr is non-zero, writes to this register are ignored.

        \begin{commentary}
            \Fcmderr inhibits starting a new command to accommodate debuggers
            that, for performance reasons, send several commands to be executed
            in a row without checking \Fcmderr in between. They can safely do
            so and check \Fcmderr at the end without worrying that one command
            failed but then a later command (which might have depended on the
            previous one succeeding) passed.

        Basic read/write registers that may be read or changed by abstract

        command is executed. The only guarantees on their contents are the ones
        offered by the command in question. If the command fails, no

        If \Fserialcount is 0, this register is not present.

        This register provides access to the data queues of the serial port

        A read from this register reads the oldest entry in the
        debugger-to-core queue, and removes that entry from the queue.  If the
        queue is empty, then the read fails.

        A write to this register adds the written data to the core-to-debugger
        queue. If that queue is already full or its overflow bit is set, then
        the write fails and the overflow bit becomes set.
