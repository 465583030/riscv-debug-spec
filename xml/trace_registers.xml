        <field name="wrapped" bits="24" access="R" reset="0">
            1 if the trace buffer has wrapped since the last time \Fdiscard was
            written. 0 otherwise.

            Emit Store Data trace sequences.

        <field name="fullaction" bits="9:8" access="R/W" reset="0">
            Determine what happens when the trace buffer is full.  0 means wrap
            and overwrite. 1 means turn off trace until \Fdiscard is written as 1.
            2 means cause a trace full exception. 3 is reserved for future use.

        <field name="destination" bits="5:4" access="R/W" reset="Preset">
            0: Trace to a dedicated on-core RAM (which is not further defined in
            this spec).
            
            1: Trace to RAM on the system bus.

            2: Send trace data to a dedicated off-chip interface (which is not
            defined in this spec). This does not affect execution speed.

            3: Reserved for future use.

            Options 0 and 1 slow down execution (eg. because of system bus
            contention).

        <field name="stall" bits="2" access="R/W" reset="1">
            When 1, the trace logic may stall processor execution to ensure it
            can emit all the trace sequences required. When 0 individual trace
            sequences may be dropped.

        <field name="discard" bits="1" access="W1" reset="0">
            Writing 1 to this bit tells the trace logic that any trace
            collected is no longer required. When tracing to RAM, it resets the
            trace write pointer to the start of the memory, as well as
            \Fwrapped.
