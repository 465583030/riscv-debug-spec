        This register allows access to the Debug Module Interface (DMI).

        In Update-DR, the DTM starts the operation specified in \Fop unless the
        current status reported in \Fop is sticky.

        In Capture-DR, the DTM updates \Fdata with the result from that
        operation, updating \Fop if the current \Fop isn't sticky.

        See Section~\ref{dmiaccess} and Table~\ref{tab:memread} for examples
        of how this is used.

        \begin{commentary}
        The still-in-progress status is sticky to accommodate debuggers that
        batch together a number of scans, which must all be executed or stop as
        soon as there's a problem.

        For instance a series of scans may write a Debug Program and execute
        it.  If one of the writes fails but the execution continues, then the
        Debug Program may hang, or have other unexpected side effects.
        \end{commentary}

        <field name="address" bits="abits+33:34" access="R/W" reset="0">
            Address used for DMI access. In Update-DR this value is used

            When the debugger writes this field, it has the following meaning:

            0: Ignore \Fdata. (nop)

            1: Read from \Faddress. (read)

            2: Write \Fdata to \Faddress. (write)

            3: Reserved.

            When the debugger reads this field, it means the following:

            0: The previous operation completed successfully.

            1: Reserved.

            2: The previous operation returned a non-zero value in \Fop.
            The data scanned into \Rdmi in this access will be ignored.
            This status is sticky and can be cleared by writing \Fdmireset
            in \Rdtmcontrol.

            \begin{commentary}
            This indicates that the DM itself responded with an error, e.g.
            in the System Bus and Serial Port overflow/underflow cases.
            Generally this means that for this type of DM access, the DTM should
            allow more time between Update-DR and Capture-DR. The most portable way
            to achieve this is to spend more TCK ticks in Run-Test/Idle state
            for similar operations.
            \end{commentary}

            3: The previous DMI request is still in progress. The data scanned
            into \Rdmi in this access will be ignored. This status is sticky
            and can be cleared by writing \Fdmireset in \Rdtmcontrol. If a
            debugger sees this status, it needs to give the target more TCK
            edges between Update-DR and Capture-DR. The simplest way
            to do that is to add extra transitions in Run-Test/Idle.

            \begin{commentary}
            The DTM, DM, and/or component may be in different clock domains, so
            synchronization may be required. Some relatively fixed number of TCK
            ticks may be needed for the request to reach the DM, complete, and
            for the response to be synchronized back into the TCK domain.
            This status is intended to cover these cases, and is orthogonal to
            the causes for case 2.
